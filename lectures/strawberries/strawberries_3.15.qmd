# EDA: Preparing Strawberry data for analysis

Due: March 21

As described in class, this document is a starter for the Midterm project.

Your assignment is to clean, organize, and explore the data. Turn in a report that describes how your work has set the stage for further analysis and model building.

The dataset contains strawberry farming data with details about conventional and organic cultivation. These data include information about chemicals used in strawberry farming, as well as sales, revenue and expense details.

While there is no "right answer" for this assignment, there are characteristics for the report that are essential. For example, sata visualization is critical. So is producing tabular presentations and document structure. Your target audience consists of analysts who may take the next steps with the data analysis and modeling.

Think of your report as a stage on which to showcase your ability to use R to work with data and produce professional reports. This is an opportunity to do some data storytelling.

Submit your report on or before March 21 using the Midterm portal on Blackboard.

## Introduction: foundations

Before we begin to work with the strawberry data, let's talk about how we will approach the work.

### Data cleaning and organization

Cleaning and organizing data for analysis is an essential skill for data scientists. Serious data analyses must be presented with the data on which the results depend. The credibility of data analysis and modelling depends on the care taken in data preparation and organization.

#### References

In their handbook ["An introduction to data cleaning with R" by Edwin de Jonge and Mark van der Loo](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf), de Jonge and van der Loo go into detail about specific data cleaning isssues and how to handle them in R.

["Problems, Methods, and Challenges in Comprehensive Data Cleansing" by Heiko MÃ¼ller and Johann-Christoph Freytag](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Heiko-Mueller/publication/228929938_Problems_methods_and_challenges_in_comprehensive_data_cleansing/links/09e415101b58541e2c000000/Problems-methods-and-challenges-in-comprehensive-data-cleansing.pdf) is a good companion to the de Jonge and van der Loo handbook, offering additional issues in their discussion.

### Attitudes

Mechanistic descriptions of data cleaning methods are insufficient.

#### Data is the product (or by-product) of purposeful human activity

Much of the data used in analysis accessed on local databases or online which may create the impression that the data have been carefully curated. Beware. Data are produced by people for a purpose, with a point-of-view, and at a time and location that may affect the data. The provenance and lineage of the data are meta data you should include when reporting analysis. Data collection is purposeful human activity with all of the risks and weaknesses that are part of any purposeful human activity.

#### Data is language

Data has meaning. Data can be included in sentences related to the meaning of the data. Cleaning and organizing data should be informed by the meaning the data convey and how that meaning relates to the research you are doing do achieve this important result.

-   Immerse yourself in the data. Put data into context.

-   Visualize the data to find problems, confirm your understandings, and plan your data organization. People do a bad job of seeing meaningful patterns in data but a good job of seeing patterns of all kinds when data are rendered as plots. As you product and show visualizations, ask your self and those who view your presentations, "what do you see?" and "what do you wonder?"

## Example: Strawberries

### Public information

[Strawberry makes list of cancer-fighting foods-2023May31](https://issuu.com/mechlocal/docs/053123_mech_asf/s/25386339)

## What is the question?

-   Where they are grown? By whom?

-   Are they really loaded with carcinogenic poisons?

-   Are they really good for your health? Bad for your health?

-   Are organic strawberries carriers of deadly diseases?

-   When I go to the market should I buy conventional or organic strawberries?

## The data

The data set for this assignment has been selected from:

                                   "new"),
                         too_many = "error",
                         too_few = "align_start"
                                               )
str_cen_c_22b <- str_cen_c_22b |> drop_one_value_col(prt_val = T)  

## OH! there are producers and operators

str_cen_c_22c  <- str_cen_c_22b |>
  separate_wider_delim(  cols = old,
                         delim = "F ",
                         names = c("old1", 
                                   "type"),

rm(str_cen_c_22b, str_cen_c_22c)
  
```

Now we can see how this table is shaping up. We're going to get information about the structure of the industry and the financial results in 2021 and 2022.

Now let's split the table further to isolate those results and try to make sense of them. We are likely to need some external information.

```{r}
#| label: looking at operations and producers separately

str_cen_c_22_op <- str_cen_c_22 |> filter(type == "OPERATIONS")

str_cen_c_22_pr <- str_cen_c_22 |> filter(type == "PRODUCERS")


```

There's still too much information here. Let's build a table that examines Net Income by Area Operated

```{r}
#| label: str_cen_c_22_op Net Income by Area Harvested

library(readr)
library(scales)

netinc_area <- str_cen_c_22_op |> filter(Domain == "AREA OPERATED")

netinc_total <- str_cen_c_22_op |> filter(new =="NET INCOME" & Domain == "TOTAL")


a <- sum(parse_number(netinc_area$Value))
a

format(a, big.mark=",")
## millions
format(round(a/1000000,1), big.mark=",")

format(round(a/10^6,1), big.mark=",")

dollar <- label_currency(a, 
              accuracy = NULL,
             scale = 1,
             prefix = "$",
             suffix = "",
              big.mark = ",",
             decimal.mark = ".",
               trim = TRUE,
            largest_with_fractional = 1e+05 )

label_currency(accuracy=.01, 
             scale_cut=cut_short_scale())(a)

label_currency(accuracy=NULL, 
             scale_cut=cut_long_scale())(a)


```

To build a table, use the data in the Domain Category, Value and CV% columns.

```{r}
#| label: build a table

## get the range out of Doman Category

netinc_area_1  <- netinc_area |>
  separate_wider_delim(  cols = `Domain Category`,
                         delim = ": ",
                         names = c("title", 
                                   "range"),
                         too_many = "error",
                         too_few = "align_start")

netinc_area_1$range <- gsub("[()]", "", netinc_area_1$range)

netinc_area_1$range <- gsub(" ACRES", "", netinc_area_1$range)

netinc_area_1$range <- gsub(" OR ", " TO ", netinc_area_1$range)

netinc_area_1  <- netinc_area_1 |>
  separate_wider_delim(  cols = range,
                         delim = " TO ",
                         names = c("lower", 
                                   "upper"),
                         too_many = "error",
                         too_few = "align_start")

netinc_area_1$lower <- parse_number(netinc_area_1$lower)

netinc_area_1$upper <- parse_number(netinc_area_1$upper) |> round(0)

netinc_area_1 <- netinc_area_1 |>arrange(lower)

netinc_area_table <- netinc_area_1 |> select(lower, upper, Value, `CV (%)`)

netinc_area_table$Value <- parse_number(netinc_area_table$Value)


netinc_area_table |> kable()

netinc_area_table |> kbl(caption = "Californina Average Net Income in 2022 by area cultivated  ") |> kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria") |> add_header_above(c( "Area Range (acres)" = 2, " " = 1, " " = 1))


```
